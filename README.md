ZooNet - Modular Composition of ZooKeepers
============
 ZooNet is a prototype of our modular composition concept over ZooKeeper. ZooNet allows users to compose multiple ZooKeepers 
 ensembles in a consistent fashion, facilitating applications that execute in multiple regions. In ZooNet, clients that 
 access only local data suffer no performance penalty compared to working with a standard single ZooKeeper. Clients that use 
 remote and local ZooKeepers show up to 7x performance improvement compared to consistent solutions available today.

ZooNet appeared in [Usenix ATC'16](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc16/technical-sessions/presentation/lev-ari), the paper can be found [here](http://kfirlevari.com/publication/download/modular-composition-of-coordination-services).
